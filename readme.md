# Practice your Dom-Manipulation skills!


- add a button to the page. When you click the button, the sum of the numbers in the array should be calculated and displayed on the page. At the moment the sum is displayed all the time on the page, but you need to change this!

To solve this, you need to do following: 
1. Create the button in the Html file
2. Add an event listener to the button
3. Call the function `calculateSum` in the event listener. 
5. Move the display of the sum into the event listener as well.



- Try out: change the styling of your page using Dom-Manipulation. For this you can add another button and when you click on it, the style changes. For this you need to look into how to change (toggle) classes on an element using JS. 

1. Create some styling in a css-file
2. Add a button to click on to change the style
3. Add an event listener to the button 
4. In the callback function of the eventlistener, add (or remove) the class with styling to the element which should change styling.
